  <b>RetroLiveTiming for F1</b>
</h1>

<p align="center">
  Retro LiveTiming is an app made to display formula 1 live timing statistics in a layout style the teams have in they're garages and on the pitwall.<br>
  This app uses the api of <a href="https://multiviewer.app/download">F1MuliViewer</a> to fetch data off of archived sessions or live sessions of Formula1-Races, Qualifying or Practice-Sessions.<br>
  <br>
  The goal to achieve is a fully functional app that can display different layouts of different years with the possibility for the user to customize as much as possible.<br>
</p>
<!--   <span align="left">For example:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Color Customization</li>
    <li>Selectable Font-Family and automatic scaling</li>
    <li>Possibility to customize and own layout</li>
    <li>Color Customization</li>
    <li>Color Customization</li>
    <li>Color Customization</li>
  </ul> -->


## Dependencies
This app needs F1MultiViewer to run. Download the F1MultiViewer <a href="https://multiviewer.app/download">here</a>
> [!Important]
> In order to use both apps (or at least MultiViewer), a paid <a href="https://www.formula1.com/de-de/subscribe-to-f1-tv">F1TV Pro subscription</a> is required!

## Usage
As for now, this app is only available as a portable version for Windows. Download the zip from the <a href="">latest releases</a>, unzip it into a folder and run it with the exe file.

## Features
> [!NOTE]
> The first early access versions are a "nearly identical copy" of the official Formula 1 documentation from 2007. Functional requests will be taken into account as soon as this is completed and running stable.

This app features currently one main window with 4 pages. Each page displays a different set of data.


## Transparency
This application is not open-source yet. As long as this app is in full development, it will stay as it is.<br>
Plans to open the relative repository to the public are not present. I want to focus on making this app as stable and user friendly as possible. Getting my head into code transparency so you are able to read what I produce is not my main focus.


## TODO [Plans / Fixes / Future]
- [ ] Better file structure -> Minimizing and optimizing code, outsource code like functions and components to differnt files. / Better structure of css files (one file per page/component) / Better classification of elements
- [ ] get the session timer running
- [ ] Biggest todo: SETTINGS
- [ ] Create page 4
- [ ] Revise page 1 and 3
